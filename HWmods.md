# What I modded and why

## PEI Sheet

The shipped Sheet is ok-ish, but far from usable like charm. So I switched to the LDO Motors Spare-Pei for Voron 2.4 350mm.

## Filament holder

That's a topic not everyone has, but as it's not my only printer, I have filament in boxes or dryer boxes, so I got rid of the spool holder and modified the filament sensor mechanism to my needs.
A model that even adds a filament cleaner can be found (later) inside the models folder.

## Feeds

I have created some bamboo-ish feed made of TPU that worked better against that movement noises.
Although I have designed a base for the self-aligning anti-vibration [Hula feed (by thrutheframe) ](https://makerworld.com/en/models/417509#profileId-319901) to attach the SV08 to the Voron version. Model can be found in Mods/Hula Feed

## MCU FAN

The shipped fan is really noisy. I swapped it with a Noctua 24V 4010 as 1:1 replacement. But I even got enough external airflow below my printer.

## Housing

Due to the fact that i completed my order of the SV08 on launchday in the first 20 seconds, I ordered only the base machine. Later I ordered the housing.
But even if I received my SV08 end of may, as one of the first europe's retail units. I don't have the housing today. So i took the cart of the shipping box, modified it with some foil and mounted it to the printer.
I have not counted with that long time to drive that solution.

## Printhead

I would lie if i say i love that printhead, but even if i have a complete spare stealthburner printhead laying around, I did not have gone that way till today.
Mostly because, i would want to use the existing printhead electronics like in my voron 2.4 as both have can boards, so i would need to design a extruder part to fit the given board and extruder style. Because why should I attach a standard cw2 when the planetary gears system is not that bad.
